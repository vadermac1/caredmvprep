  about: [
    "Kansas driver licensing is administered by the Kansas Department of Revenue (DOR), Division of Vehicles — not a traditional DMV. The DOR Division of Vehicles operates licensing offices throughout Kansas. The knowledge test consists of 25 multiple-choice questions from the Kansas Driver's License Manual, with 80% (20 out of 25 correct) required to pass. Kansas's permit age of 14 is among the youngest in the nation. Kansas Senate Bill 6, effective July 1, 2025, established one of the most recently enacted hands-free driving laws in the country.",
    "Kansas I-70 is infamous for crosswind conditions: sustained winds of 30–50 mph regularly cross the highway, and high-profile vehicles such as RVs, box trucks, and empty trailers have been blown off the road. KDOT issues crosswind advisories and specific restrictions for high-profile vehicles in extreme wind events. Kansas's flat terrain also creates significant tornado hazards — the state sits in the center of 'Tornado Alley' and experiences frequent tornado activity. Kansas drivers must know that sheltering under a highway overpass is dangerous and that lying flat in a low ditch is the correct protocol.",
    "Kansas has distinct open range rules depending on geography: eastern Kansas is generally fenced range (where ranchers are responsible for keeping livestock off roads), while western Kansas is largely open range (where livestock may legally be on roads and drivers may bear responsibility if they hit cattle). The Kansas Turnpike (I-335, also segments of I-70 through the Wichita area managed by the Kansas Turnpike Authority) uses toll collection that drivers must navigate with exact change or K-TAG electronic transponders.",

      correctIndex: 3,
      explanation:
        "Kansas issues instruction permits at age 14, one of the youngest permit ages in the nation. Permit holders must be accompanied by a licensed driver 21 or older whenever they are driving.

      explanation:
        "In western Kansas open range territory, livestock may legally be on public roads, and if a driver hits cattle, the driver may be liable for damages to the animals. This open range doctrine makes it the driver's responsibility to be alert for livestock on roads in these areas. Eastern Kansas is generally fenced range, where ranchers are legally responsible for keeping animals off roads. Cattle crossing signs on Kansas highways indicate areas where livestock regularly cross — reduce speed and watch carefully in these areas.",

      question:
        "I-70 through Kansas has a rural interstate speed limit of 75 mph. When might KDOT reduce or restrict speed on I-70?",
      options: [
        "KDOT never changes the 75 mph speed limit under any conditions",
        "Speed reductions are only used in construction zones, never for weather",

      correctIndex: 2,
      explanation:
        "While I-70 in rural Kansas has a 75 mph speed limit, KDOT monitors weather conditions and road hazards and can implement variable speed limits, crosswind restriction advisories for high-profile vehicles, and road closures during severe events. High winds, blizzards, ice events, and dust storms can all trigger KDOT alerts on I-70. Kansas has experienced dust storms (from agricultural fields) that reduce visibility to near zero and have caused multi-vehicle pileups on I-70. Drivers should monitor KDOT's 511 road conditions service before and during travel on I-70.",

      question: "What are I-70 crosswind dangers in Kansas?",
      answer:
        "Kansas I-70 is notorious for sustained crosswinds of 30–50 mph — among the highest consistent crosswind conditions on any U.S. interstate. These crosswinds can push high-profile vehicles sideways, reducing traction and control. The flat Kansas terrain provides no natural windbreaks. KDOT monitors wind conditions and issues crosswind advisories for specific vehicle types (RVs, box trucks, enclosed trailers, empty flatbeds). Drivers of high-profile vehicles should monitor KDOT's 511 service before traveling I-70 during windy weather and may need to reduce speed significantly or wait for winds to subside.",

Commercial vehicle operators face a 0.04% BAC limit when operating a CMV. Kansas DUI penalties include mandatory license suspension (30 days minimum for first offense), fines, possible jail time, and potential ignition interlock device requirements for license reinstatement.",

      question: "What is the open range rule in Kansas?",
      answer:
        "Kansas has different rules for different parts of the state. Eastern Kansas is generally fenced range: ranchers are legally responsible for keeping their livestock fenced off public roads, and a driver who hits cattle can seek damages from the rancher. Western Kansas is largely open range: livestock may legally be on public roads, and a driver who hits cattle in open range territory may be responsible for damages to the animals. Drivers in western Kansas should be especially alert on rural roads for cattle and watch for livestock crossing signs.",

      question: "What is the Kansas Turnpike and how are tolls collected?",
      answer:
        "The Kansas Turnpike Authority (KTA) operates tolled sections of Kansas interstate highways including I-335 (the main Kansas Turnpike between I-70 near Emporia and I-35 near Wichita) and portions of I-70 through the Wichita area. Tolls are collected at traditional toll plazas using either exact change cash payment or the K-TAG electronic transponder. Bypassing a toll plaza is a violation subject to fines. K-TAG transponders are available through the KTA and provide faster passage through toll plazas.",

      question: "What is the tornado safety protocol for Kansas drivers?",
      answer:
        "Kansas sits at the heart of Tornado Alley and experiences significant tornado activity. If a tornado warning is issued and a tornado threatens while you are driving, the safest actions are: drive at right angles to the tornado's path if you can safely escape it with time to spare; if you cannot escape, exit the vehicle immediately, move away from it, and lie flat and face-down in the lowest available ditch away from trees and power poles. Cover your head and neck with your arms. Never shelter under a highway overpass — the overpass creates a wind tunnel effect that concentrates and accelerates debris, which has caused fatalities in Kansas.",

      question: "What is Kansas's rural interstate speed limit?",
      answer:
        "Kansas has a 75 mph speed limit on rural sections of its interstate highways, including I-70 and I-135. This applies on rural segments away from urban and suburban areas. Near cities like Wichita, Topeka, and Kansas City, interstate speed limits drop to 65 or 70 mph. The 75 mph limit does not apply in construction zones (reduced limits are posted). Drivers should always obey posted speed limits and reduce speed below the posted limit when weather, traffic, or road conditions require it.",
