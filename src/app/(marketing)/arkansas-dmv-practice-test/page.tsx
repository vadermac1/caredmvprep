  about: [
    "Arkansas driver licensing is administered by the Department of Finance and Administration (DFA), Revenue Division — not a DMV. The DFA is Arkansas's tax and revenue agency, and placing driver licensing functions within a revenue department is nationally unusual. Most states use a DMV, licensing division, or motor vehicle administration within a transportation or public safety department. DFA driver licensing offices are located throughout the state. The knowledge test consists of 25 multiple-choice questions requiring at least 20 correct answers (80%) to pass. Arkansas's instruction permit age of 14 makes it one of the youngest permit ages in the country.",
    "Arkansas Act 1018, effective January 1, 2024, established a comprehensive statewide hands-free law for all drivers. Before Act 1018, Arkansas only prohibited texting while driving for novice drivers — adult drivers faced no statewide prohibition on handheld phone use. This made Arkansas one of the last states in the U.S. to enact a statewide adult handheld ban. Act 1018 fines: $250 for a first offense; $500 for subsequent offenses. The law is primary enforcement — officers can stop a driver solely for holding a wireless device. ACA § 27-51-1404 makes it a Class A misdemeanor to drive around a 'Road Closed' sign or flood barrier in Arkansas — a criminal offense that is enforced particularly in the Ozark and Ouachita mountain regions where flash flooding can occur rapidly on the Arkansas River, White River, and Buffalo River systems.",
    "Arkansas has two distinctive wildlife and environmental road hazards that appear in its driver knowledge exam. Feral hogs (Sus scrofa) in Arkansas number approximately 2+ million animals statewide — one of the highest feral swine populations in the eastern United States. Unlike deer (which typically cross roads singly), feral hogs travel in family groups called sounders of 10–30 animals, each weighing 200–400 pounds. A driver encountering a sounder crossing a rural road at night may strike multiple large animals in rapid succession before stopping, causing catastrophic vehicle damage. The Arkansas River, White River, and Buffalo National River systems can produce flash flooding within minutes of heavy rainfall. The Buffalo National River corridor (AR-74, AR-21, AR-7) and numerous Ozark-region low-water bridges (low-water crossings) flood rapidly and are marked with barricades when impassable.",

      explanation:
        "Arkansas Code § 27-51-1404 makes it a Class A misdemeanor to drive around a 'Road Closed' sign or flood barrier in Arkansas. This criminal charge — not merely a traffic infraction — was enacted to deter drivers from attempting to cross flooded roadways after barriers have been placed. Flash flooding in the Ozark and Ouachita mountain river valleys can occur within minutes of heavy rain. Even water that appears shallow on a road surface can be moving fast enough to sweep away a vehicle. The criminal charge means potential jail time, fines, and a permanent record.",

      question: "What makes feral hog collisions in Arkansas distinctively dangerous compared to single-animal deer collisions?",
      options: [
        "Feral hogs are protected wildlife in Arkansas — drivers are legally liable for any hog struck on the road",
        "Feral hogs are faster than deer and cannot be avoided with standard braking distances",

      explanation:
        "Feral hogs in Arkansas travel in family groups called sounders — typically 10 to 30 animals, each weighing 200 to 400 pounds. When a sounder crosses a rural road at night, a driver may collide with multiple large animals before stopping, causing catastrophic damage to the vehicle and serious risk to occupants. This group-crossing behavior is fundamentally different from single-animal deer encounters.

      explanation:
        "Arkansas driver licensing is administered by the Department of Finance and Administration (DFA), Revenue Division — a tax and revenue agency. Placing driver licensing within a revenue/finance department is nationally unusual; most states use a standalone DMV, licensing division, or a motor vehicle administration within a transportation or public safety agency.

      explanation:
        "Arkansas issues instruction permits at age 14 — one of the youngest permit ages in the United States. Most states allow permits at 15 or 15½ years old. Permit holders in Arkansas must always be accompanied by a licensed driver who is at least 21 years old seated in the front passenger seat. A restricted license becomes available at age 16, and a full unrestricted license is available at age 18. The young permit age reflects Arkansas's rural character and the practical need for teen drivers in agricultural and spread-out communities.",

      explanation:
        "Arkansas has a maximum interstate speed limit of 70 mph. Four-lane divided highways outside urban areas are posted at 65 mph. Two-lane highways typically carry limits of 55–65 mph depending on the specific route and terrain. Mountain roads in the Ozarks and Ouachitas may have lower posted limits due to curves and grades. Arkansas's 70 mph interstate maximum is among the higher limits in the south-central region, though lower than some western states' 75–80 mph limits.",

        "They are only found on unpaved roads and not a concern for drivers on paved state highways",
        "They are designed to be submerged and provide no visual indication of water depth from the driver's vantage point — moving water can be far deeper and faster than it appears",
        "They are clearly marked with permanent depth gauges that accurately show current water levels at all times",
        "They only flood during winter snowmelt — summer rainfall does not typically affect low-water crossings",
      ],
      correctIndex: 1,
      explanation:
        "Low-water crossings (also called low-water bridges or simply 'dips') are designed to be submerged during high water — they sit at or near road level and allow flood water to flow over them. When flooded, they provide no visual indication of water depth from the driver's perspective; the crossing can appear passable but may have 2–3 feet of fast-moving water over it. A driver who attempts to cross is at serious risk of being swept off the crossing. Barricades are placed at these crossings when impassable — driving around those barricades is a Class A misdemeanor under ACA § 27-51-1404.",

      explanation:
        "The roads in the Buffalo National River corridor — AR-74 (Arkansas Highway 74), AR-21, and AR-7 (the Scenic 7 Byway) — are narrow two-lane mountain roads with minimal shoulders, tight switchbacks, limited or no guardrails, and some unpaved sections. These roads have seasonal closure periods during winter storms or after flooding. The Buffalo National River itself experiences rapid flooding after heavy rain, which can close these low-elevation road crossings without warning. Drivers unfamiliar with these conditions should check NPS and ARDOT road status before travel.",

      correctIndex: 2,
      explanation:
        "Arkansas sets its underage DWI threshold at 0.02% BAC for drivers under 21 — a near-zero tolerance standard. This is consistent with the approach of most U.S. states, which use 0.02% as the measurable threshold while implementing a practical zero-tolerance policy for underage drinking and driving. A first underage DWI in Arkansas results in a license suspension and mandatory participation in an alcohol education program. The adult standard of 0.08% does not apply to drivers under 21.",

DFA driver licensing offices are located in cities and counties throughout the state. When searching for where to get your Arkansas driver's license, look for 'DFA Revenue Division' or 'Arkansas driver's license office' — not 'DMV.'

Hands-free use — via Bluetooth, a mounted holder, or speakerphone without touching the device — is permitted. The law is primary enforcement and applies to all drivers regardless of age. First offense fine: $250. Subsequent offenses: $500.

      answer:
        "ACA § 27-51-1404 makes it a Class A misdemeanor — a criminal offense — to drive around or past a 'Road Closed' sign or flood barrier in Arkansas. The law was enacted because drivers who ignore flood barriers frequently become flood fatalities. In the Ozark and Ouachita mountain regions, rivers and streams can rise dramatically within minutes of heavy rain, turning paved road crossings into deadly traps. The official safety guidance is 'Turn Around, Don't Drown.' Even water that appears shallow can be moving fast enough to sweep away a vehicle. Class A misdemeanor consequences include potential jail time and a criminal record.",

When a sounder crosses a rural road at night (when hogs are most active), a driver may collide with multiple large animals before being able to stop — causing catastrophic vehicle damage and serious injury risk. Standard deer-avoidance techniques (single braking event) are not adequate when multiple large animals block the road. Feral hog collisions are treated as wildlife collisions — not covered by standard livestock collision liability.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is Arkansas's permit age and GDL program?",
      answer:
        "Arkansas GDL stages: (1) Instruction permit at age 14 — must be accompanied by a licensed driver 21+ in the front seat at all times; (2) Restricted license at age 16 after holding the permit for at least 6 months and completing 30 hours of supervised driving (10 at night) — restricted driving hours and passenger limits apply; (3) Full unrestricted license at age 18. Arkansas's 14-year-old permit age is one of the youngest in the United States and reflects the rural character of much of the state.",

      question: "What is Arkansas's DWI terminology and how does it differ from DUI?",
      answer:
        "Arkansas uses DWI (Driving While Intoxicated) under ACA § 5-65-103 — not DUI. The distinction is purely terminological; the legal structure is similar to DUI laws in other states. Adult threshold: 0.08% BAC. Under-21: 0.02% BAC. CDL holders in a commercial vehicle: 0.04%. First-offense DWI penalties: 6-month license suspension, $150–$1,000 fine, and possible jail time. Second DWI within 5 years: harsher penalties including possible IID. The DWI terminology is tested on the Arkansas knowledge exam.",

The Buffalo National River itself floods rapidly after rain, closing adjacent road crossings without much warning. Check NPS.gov/buff and ARDOT for current road conditions before traveling in this area.",

      question: "What are Arkansas's maximum speed limits?",
      answer:
        "Arkansas maximum speed limits: 70 mph on interstates; 65 mph on four-lane divided highways outside urban areas; 55 mph on most two-lane state highways; lower posted limits on mountain roads in the Ozarks and Ouachitas.

If corrective lenses are required to meet this standard, the license will carry a restriction requiring the driver to wear glasses or contacts while driving. Applicants who cannot meet the 20/50 standard with correction may be eligible for a restricted license or may be referred to a vision specialist for further evaluation. Vision is screened at the DFA office during the license application process.",
