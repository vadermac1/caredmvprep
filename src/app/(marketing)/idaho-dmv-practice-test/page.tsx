  about: [
    "The Idaho Transportation Department (ITD), Division of Motor Vehicles, administers driver licensing for Idaho residents. Unlike most states, Idaho's knowledge test consists of 40 questions — one of the longest knowledge tests in the nation — requiring 34 correct answers (85%) to pass — one of the highest passing thresholds in the nation. The test covers Idaho's Driver's Manual including traffic laws, road signs, and Idaho-specific hazards. Idaho's permit age of 14½ allows young residents to begin learning to drive earlier than most states.",
    "Idaho's open range law (Idaho Code § 25-2118) is one of the most important laws for Idaho drivers to understand, and it is the opposite of what most people expect. In open range areas of Idaho, if a driver hits cattle on the road, the driver bears legal responsibility for damages to the animals — not the rancher. The rancher is not required to fence livestock out of the right-of-way in open range territory. This open range doctrine applies throughout much of rural southern and central Idaho and makes watching for livestock on roadways a legal — not merely a safety — obligation for Idaho drivers.",
    "Idaho HB 236, effective July 1, 2024, established a hands-free driving law banning all handheld device use while driving — Idaho was among the more recent states to enact comprehensive handheld device legislation. Southern Idaho's Snake River Plain presents dust devil hazards on hot days, while the Sawtooth Mountains (ID-75) and Salmon River Canyon (US-95) present mountain driving challenges including steep grades, rockfall, and possible snowfall at elevation at any time of year. August through October brings heavy agricultural equipment traffic for potato and grain harvest in southern Idaho.",

    {
      question:
        "Under Idaho Code § 25-2118 (open range law), if a driver hits cattle on a rural Idaho road, who is legally responsible for damages?",
      options: [
        "The rancher who owns the cattle, because ranchers are required to fence all livestock",
        "The driver, because in open range areas the driver must prove the animal was not lawfully in the right-of-way",
        "Neither party — livestock collisions are considered accidents with no liability",
        "The Idaho Transportation Department, because they manage public roads",
      ],
      correctIndex: 1,
      explanation:
        "Idaho's open range law is counterintuitive: in open range territory, livestock have a legal right to be on the road, and the driver who hits them is responsible for damages to the animals — not the rancher. The driver must prove the livestock were NOT lawfully in the right-of-way to avoid liability. This is the opposite of how liability works in fenced-range states, where ranchers are responsible for keeping animals off public roads. Open range territory covers much of rural southern and central Idaho.",

    {
      question:
        "Idaho House Bill 236, effective July 1, 2024, prohibits which behavior for Idaho drivers?",
      options: [
        "Using a GPS app on a phone mounted on the dashboard",
        "Talking through a Bluetooth headset",
        "Holding a wireless device while driving",

Hands-free use — such as a GPS app on a dashboard-mounted phone, Bluetooth calling, or speakerphone placed on a mount — is permitted. The law took effect July 1, 2024, and is a primary enforcement law, meaning officers can stop a driver solely for holding a device. Idaho was one of the later states in the nation to pass a comprehensive handheld device ban.",

        "What is the minimum age to obtain an instruction permit in Idaho?",
      options: ["15 years old", "16 years old", "14½ years old", "14 years old"],
      correctIndex: 2,
      explanation:

        "You are driving through southern Idaho's Snake River Plain on a sunny day and see a dust devil crossing the road ahead. What should you do?",
      options: [
        "Accelerate to pass through it quickly before it reaches your lane",
        "Slow down and turn on your headlights — dust devils can suddenly reduce visibility",

        "Dust devils pose no road hazard and require no driving adjustment",
      ],
      correctIndex: 1,
      explanation:
        "Dust devils on the Snake River Plain form when hot air near the ground rises rapidly, creating a rotating column of dust, debris, and sometimes small rocks. They can appear suddenly and reduce visibility to near zero for a few seconds as they cross a road. The correct response is to slow down and turn on headlights to make your vehicle more visible to others. Do not swerve into other lanes. Dust devils are generally short-lived but can carry enough debris to cause windshield chips and distract drivers.",

        "On ID-75 (Sawtooth Scenic Byway) above 7,000 feet elevation, what weather hazard can occur at any month of the year?",
      options: [
        "Flooding from snowmelt that overflows onto the road",
        "Lightning strikes that can disable vehicle electrical systems",

      explanation:
        "Idaho's DUI law sets a BAC limit of 0.02% for drivers under 21 — a near-zero tolerance policy. For drivers 21 and older, the standard 0.08% BAC limit applies. Idaho DUI penalties include mandatory license suspension, fines, and potential ignition interlock device requirements. Even small amounts of alcohol impair driving ability, and the 0.02% threshold reflects the state's policy that underage drivers should have virtually no alcohol in their system when operating a vehicle.",

      explanation:
        "US-95 through the Salmon River Canyon in central Idaho has documented rockfall hazards from the steep canyon walls above, road sections carved into cliffsides with no guardrail, and single-lane passing zones at certain narrow canyon sections where drivers must yield according to posted signs. Drivers should reduce speed from posted limits when conditions warrant, watch for rock debris on the road surface, and pay attention to single-lane zone signage. The canyon route is scenic but requires attentive, conservative driving.",

      question: "What agricultural driving hazards are specific to southern Idaho?",
      answer:
        "Southern Idaho's agricultural industry — primarily potatoes, grain, and dairy — creates specific road hazards from August through October during harvest season. Heavy, wide, and slow-moving farm equipment (potato harvesters, combines, grain wagons) travels on rural roads at 25 mph or less. Drivers must slow down, maintain safe following distance, and pass only when safe. On dry days in the Snake River Plain, potato and grain harvest also creates dust plumes that can reduce visibility on adjacent roads. Dust devils are common on hot, sunny days.",

      question: "What is Idaho's permit age and who can supervise a permit holder?",
      answer:
        "Idaho's instruction permit is available at age 14½. The permit holder must be accompanied at all times by a licensed driver who is at least 21 years old and seated in the front seat. Idaho law requires the supervising driver to hold a valid Idaho driver's license. Permit holders may not drive after midnight or carry passengers outside the immediate family without the supervising driver present. After meeting all GDL requirements, a provisional license is available at age 15.",

    {
      question: "What are dust devils and why are they a hazard on Idaho roads?",
      answer:
        "Dust devils are small but intense whirlwinds that form when ground-level hot air rises rapidly, creating a rotating column of dust, dry soil, and debris. They are common on the Snake River Plain in southern Idaho on hot, sunny days. Dust devils can appear suddenly on or near roads and momentarily reduce visibility to near zero. They can also carry rocks and debris that can chip windshields. Drivers should slow down and turn on headlights when a dust devil is near their path, but should not swerve suddenly into other lanes to avoid them.",

      question: "Does Idaho have a vehicle safety inspection requirement?",
      answer:
        "Idaho does not require periodic vehicle safety inspections for most passenger vehicles. Vehicles must meet safety equipment standards (lights, brakes, etc.) to operate legally on Idaho roads, but Idaho does not have a mandatory annual or biennial inspection program. Some commercial vehicles are subject to FMCSA inspection requirements. New residents registering vehicles in Idaho from states with inspection requirements should still ensure their vehicles are in safe operating condition, as defective equipment violations can result in traffic citations.",
